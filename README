Start with `start.sh` ----------------------------------------------------------

    It'll compile your Java app (in `whatever`), and host it in a Tomcat server.

In the box ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    Right now, it's got two servlet configured, which only echo out the
    requestURL and the headers.  The only difference between these two is
    the use of `javax` vs `jakarta`: if you use `tomcat` 10 or later in
    `Dockerfile`, only the one using jakarta will be scanned, and vice-versa
    using `tomcat` 9 or earlier.

    You can edit the `server.xml`. Right now, it's got a basic RemoteIpValve
    configured.

Testing ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Some quick test lines (that pertain to some RemoveIpValve exploration) are
    available in `test.sh`.
